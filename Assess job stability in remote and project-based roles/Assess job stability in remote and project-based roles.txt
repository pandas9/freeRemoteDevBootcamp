Assessing job stability is one of the most common concerns among remote developers.

I've been there, and many of you might be grappling with the same uncertainties. Today, I want to share my personal experiences and lessons learned, with the hope that they will provide some clarity.

One of the first insights I gained in my early days as a remote developer was the immense value of a client's history. It struck me that, just as in traditional workplaces, a client's past behavior could serve as a reliable compass, pointing towards their future actions. Whenever I'm contemplating a new project, I make it a point to delve into the client's history on the platform. Why, you ask? Because their past can unveil a wealth of information about their work habits, their treatment of developers, and their overall dependability.

I have found that if a client has a track record of long-term projects and has consistently provided work for their previous developers, that's a green signal for job stability. Conversely, if a client is frequently switching developers or abruptly ending projects, it could be a warning bell signaling potential instability.

Just like in traditional employment settings, past behavior can be a reliable predictor of future actions. When I consider a new project, I always look into the client's history on platform.

Why is this so crucial? A client's history can provide valuable insights into their work patterns, their treatment of past developers, and their overall reliability.

For instance, if a client has a history of long-term projects and has consistently provided work for their previous developers, it's a strong indicator of job stability. It suggests that they value lasting relationships and are likely to provide ongoing work, assuming the quality of work is up to their standards.

On the contrary, if a client frequently changes developers or has a history of abruptly ending projects, it could be a red flag. It might suggest potential instability, which could leave you looking for a new project sooner than anticipated.

The feedback they've given and received can reveal a lot about their communication style, their expectations, and their satisfaction with past developers. These are all crucial elements that can impact job stability.

Then there's the project's scope, an incredibly powerful tool to assess job stability. A project with a vast scope, encompassing multiple components and phases, typically implies a long-term commitment, offering a certain degree of job stability. However, smaller, short-term projects with limited scope might not provide the same level of stability, although they can sometimes lead to more work from the same client.

Scope of the project is a primary indicator of what we can expect from a client. The project's scope gives us an idea of the size of the project, the complexity, and the potential duration of our engagement with the client.

If a project has a large scope with multiple components and phases, it often implies a long-term commitment. This kind of project usually requires continuous work and ongoing development, offering a certain level of job stability. From my experience, such projects often translate into a more stable and lasting relationship with the client.

On the other hand, smaller projects with a limited scope might not offer the same level of stability. These tend to be short-term and might wrap up once the specific task at hand is completed. However, successful completion of such projects can sometimes lead to more work from the same client, depending on their needs. If its smaller project focus on clients history and if they have tendency to hire for similar projects that you can complete. 

One more critical factor I've learned to consider is the client's communication style and their vision for the project's future. Clear, consistent communication from a client is a positive sign, often indicating their high level of involvement and investment in the project. Likewise, if a client can articulate a clear roadmap for the project, it suggests a long-term commitment, offering more stability for you.

Through my journey, I've realized that it's perfectly alright, and indeed necessary, to reassess a project's stability as you delve deeper into it. If a project seems to lack a future, it might be a good idea to shift focus to other projects with higher potential.

In my experience, it's vital to regularly reassess where to invest your time and resources. For instance, if a project shows signs of a bright future, that's where I start to invest more of my efforts. On the flip side, if a client's involvement in a project is minimal, or they don't seem overly invested, it could be an indicator that the project may not last long. In such cases, while it's crucial to continue delivering your work professionally, it might be a good idea to start redirecting more of your resources towards projects that show higher potential.

As a remote developer, your time is your most valuable asset. Learning to balance it effectively across projects can significantly influence your success and job stability. I've found that being proactive and strategic in assessing a project's potential can ensure I'm investing my time wisely.

Last but not least, let me share that your relationship with your client can be a powerful barometer of job stability. If you have a healthy working relationship with your client and you're consistently meeting their expectations, there's a high likelihood that the project will continue on a stable path. But remember, even when you're comfortable with a project and a client, it's important to keep pushing yourself, innovating, and delivering your best work.
