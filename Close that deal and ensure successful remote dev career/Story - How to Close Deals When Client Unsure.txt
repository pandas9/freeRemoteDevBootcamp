Hey there, fellow developers! Welcome to the next module of our course, "How to Close Deals. " I'm excited to dive into this topic with you because it's such an essential skill for remote developers looking to make a mark in the industry and achieve financial success. Now, I know what you're thinking: "I'm a developer, not a salesperson! Why should I care about closing deals?" Trust me, I've been there, and I understand that mindset. But here's the thing: as a remote developer, you are your own advocate. The better you can communicate your value and confidently negotiate, the more likely you are to land high-paying gigs. That being said, it's perfectly okay to be yourself and not worry about becoming a "salesperson" in the traditional sense. You don't need to put on a sales hat and pretend to be someone you're not. In fact, authenticity is a huge asset when it comes to closing deals. Clients and employers appreciate genuine connections, and they'll trust you more when they feel you're being honest with them about your skills and experience. So, how do you close deals while still staying true to yourself? The key is to focus on your strengths as a developer and showcase your expertise without being overly salesy. It's essential to understand the importance of professionalism when interacting with potential clients or employers. You might be wondering why acting professionally in meetings is so important. Well, it's simple: your conduct during a meeting directly impacts how others perceive you and your abilities. If you're able to present yourself in a professional manner, you'll instill confidence in those you're meeting with and increase the likelihood of landing the gig. When you meet with potential clients or employers, the way you conduct yourself sets the tone for the relationship. A professional demeanor demonstrates that you take your work seriously and can be trusted to deliver quality results. Being professional in a meeting means actively listening, speaking clearly, and staying on topic. This helps to ensure that everyone understands the goals and expectations, which is essential for a successful project. Acting professionally during meetings helps to build trust with your clients or employers. If they believe you're reliable and committed, they're more likely to choose you for the project and, in turn, recommend you to others. As a remote developer, it's essential to showcase your knowledge and skills. A professional attitude during meetings allows you to effectively communicate your expertise and convince clients that you're the right person for the job. Acting professionally also means knowing when to say "no" and setting realistic expectations for your workload. By doing so, you'll maintain a healthy work-life balance and avoid overcommitting, which can lead to burnout. It's also important to maintain a balanced demeanor during meetings. During meetings with potential clients or employers, it's important to avoid being overly jubilant, excited, angry, or overly agreeable. Why? Because maintaining a balanced and professional demeanor helps to foster a more productive and authentic conversation. Let's dive into some reasons why this approach is vital. It's important to come across as knowledgeable and composed during meetings. If you're overly emotional or overly agreeable, others might question your expertise or judgment, which could hurt your chances of closing the deal. A balanced demeanor helps to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable expressing their thoughts and opinions. This leads to more fruitful discussions and ensures that all parties' concerns and ideas are considered. As a remote developer, professionalism is key to building trust with clients and employers. By keeping your emotions in check and avoiding excessive enthusiasm or agreement, you demonstrate that you're serious about your work and can be relied upon to deliver results. Overly agreeable or exaggerated emotional responses can come across as disingenuous. By maintaining a balanced demeanor, you show that you're genuinely interested in understanding the needs and concerns of your clients or employers, which can help to build a stronger working relationship. During the meeting it's crucial to let client talk as much as possible. You might be wondering why it's essential to make meetings all about the client and letting them talk. The answer is simple: when you focus on the client's needs and concerns, you're better equipped to offer solutions and build trust, which can significantly increase your chances of landing the project or job. By letting your clients talk and share their thoughts, you show that you're genuinely interested in understanding their needs and concerns. Active listening also allows you to gather valuable information that can help you tailor your solutions and better address their expectations. Focusing on the client helps to create a connection and establish rapport. When clients feel heard and understood, they're more likely to trust you and see you as a valuable partner. And when you allow clients to express their concerns and challenges, you can better identify their pain points. This enables you to present your skills and expertise as the solution to their problems, making it more likely that they'll choose you for the job. By giving clients the opportunity to share their ideas and feedback, you create a collaborative atmosphere where both parties can work together to achieve the best possible outcome. Most importantly when clients feel that their needs and concerns are prioritized during a meeting, they're more likely to leave with a positive impression of you and your abilities, which can increase your chances of securing the deal. There are different ways to conduct initial meetings with potential clients. Meetings don't have to strictly be 1 on 1 video meetings but can be calls, chat or video. You might be wondering why the first meeting can be via chat or video after aligning with a client about the project's basic details.

The truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to initial meetings. Clients have different preferences and comfort levels when it comes to communication, and it's important to adapt to their needs to foster a positive working relationship. Depending on the complexity of the project or the client's familiarity with the topic, a chat or voice call might be more time-efficient for discussing basic details. Clients also have different communication preferences, and some might feel more at ease using chat or voice calls instead of video calls. Determining the client's preferred communication method early on helps to establish a mutual understanding of how you'll interact throughout the project. This clarity can prevent miscommunications and ensure that both parties are on the same page. Also when you respect and adapt to a client's communication preferences from the start, it demonstrates that you're attentive to their needs, which can help build rapport and trust more quickly. Figuring out the client's preferred communication method early on can save both of you time and effort by preventing misunderstandings or missed messages. This efficiency is especially important when working with tight deadlines or juggling multiple projects. It's best to either do screen share together with the client or forward them a document containing project details or project details with your notes and understanding in case you were provided project details right away. Utilizing screen sharing or forwarding documents with project details can greatly benefit your interactions with clients. I emphasize the importance of steering clear of bad jobs. First and foremost, your time and energy are valuable. Spending your resources on pursuing opportunities that don't align with your objectives can lead to burnout and hinder your progress towards achieving your target income. Additionally, taking on bad jobs can impact your professional reputation. Clients may leave negative feedback or low ratings, which could deter potential clients in the future. It's important to maintain a positive track record to attract the best opportunities and continue to grow your career as a remote developer. Moreover, working on bad jobs can be demoralizing and affect your overall job satisfaction. Engaging in projects that don't match your expectations or involve difficult clients can lead to frustration, dissatisfaction, and a decreased motivation to continue in your remote developer career. Lastly, it's essential to recognize that every job you take on is an opportunity to learn, grow, and expand your professional network. By avoiding bad jobs, you can ensure that you're investing your time in projects that contribute to your long-term goals and facilitate your growth as a remote developer. As you embark on your remote developer journey, it's essential to make a strong and lasting impression on potential clients. Crafting personalized proposals can significantly impact your success in landing projects that align with your skills and expertise. Here's why you should never copy-paste proposals. One of the main reasons is that personalized proposals demonstrate genuine interest and effort. Clients can often recognize a copy-pasted proposal, which can lead them to question your commitment to their project. By taking the time to customize your proposal, you show clients that you're serious about their needs and dedicated to providing value. Another crucial factor is standing out from the competition. The world of remote development is competitive, and clients receive numerous proposals for their projects. By crafting a unique and tailored proposal, you can set yourself apart from other candidates and increase your chances of being selected for the job. Furthermore, personalized proposals allow you to showcase your skills and experience in a way that directly addresses the client's needs. This not only demonstrates your understanding of the project but also highlights how you're the right fit for the role. Tailoring your proposal to the specific job increases your chances of making a strong impression and getting hired. Keep in mind that every client and project is unique. Copy-pasting proposals overlooks the nuances and individual requirements of each job. By creating a custom proposal that addresses the specific needs and goals of the client, you're more likely to resonate with them and secure the project. It's vital to make a strong and lasting impression on potential clients. Creating personalized, unique proposals plays a significant role in landing projects that match your skills and goals. Clients can usually tell when a proposal is generic, which may cause them to question your dedication to their project. By investing time in customizing your proposal, you show clients that you care about their needs and are committed to delivering value. In the competitive world of remote development, standing out from the crowd is essential. Clients often receive many proposals for their projects. Willing to get on a call can make a difference in your remote development career. First, getting on a call helps establish a personal connection with clients. In remote work, it's crucial to bridge the distance between you and your clients. Calls, whether voice or video, can humanize the interaction and foster a better understanding between both parties. Second, calls can significantly improve communication clarity. Some aspects of a project may be difficult to convey through text alone. By hopping on a call, you can quickly address concerns, answer questions, and clarify any misunderstandings, ensuring that everyone stays on the same page. Third, being willing to get on a call demonstrates professionalism and commitment. Clients appreciate developers who are approachable and show a genuine interest in their project. By being open to calls, you display a willingness to engage and collaborate, which can increase your chances of landing jobs and maintaining positive client relationships. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this lesson, thank you for tuning in.

Finally, calls can be efficient and time-saving. In some cases, discussing project details or resolving issues over a call can be more productive than a lengthy back-and-forth text conversation. By getting on a call, you can quickly hash out details and move forward with the project, ultimately saving time and effort for both you and your client. let's discuss a critical aspect of engaging with potential clients: the importance of not giving a price right away and first aligning with the client's project needs. You might wonder why I emphasize delaying the price discussion and focusing on understanding the client's needs first. Initially, taking the time to understand the client's project needs shows that you genuinely care about their goals and requirements. By listening carefully and asking questions, you can demonstrate your commitment to delivering a high-quality solution tailored to their specific needs, which can create a positive first impression. Second, discussing project needs before pricing allows you to accurately assess the scope and complexity of the project. This information is crucial for providing a fair and accurate quote. By understanding the project in depth, you can avoid underestimating the work involved or overcharging the client, which can help establish trust and credibility. And third, aligning with the client's project needs before discussing the price can help you identify potential challenges or additional services you might offer. This knowledge enables you to present a more comprehensive proposal, which can increase your chances of being selected for the job. I've learned that slow response times can be a killer of a sale. When clients reach out with questions or inquiries, they expect a timely response. If you take too long to respond, they may lose interest or move on to another developer who can provide a quicker response. That's why I believe it's important to be able to answer clients right away whenever possible. This shows that you're responsive, reliable, and committed to providing excellent customer service. It also helps build trust and credibility with clients, which can lead to more sales and higher earnings. Of course, I understand that it's not always possible to respond right away. You may be busy with other projects, dealing with technical issues, or simply need more time to gather information. However, it's important to communicate with clients and let them know when they can expect a response. This helps manage their expectations and shows that you're still committed to providing excellent customer service, even if you can't respond immediately. Overall, responding quickly to clients is an important part of being a successful remote developer. It can help you build strong relationships with clients, increase sales, and ultimately lead to more success and higher earnings. In fact, studies have shown that if you can follow up within the first 60 seconds after an initial contact, it can increase conversion rates by over 320%. This may seem like a daunting task, but it's important to remember that clients are often looking for quick responses and are more likely to engage with developers who are responsive and attentive. By following up quickly, you show that you're committed to providing excellent customer service and are willing to go the extra mile to meet their needs. Of course, following up quickly isn't always easy. You may be busy with other projects, dealing with technical issues, or simply need more time to gather information. However, there are tools and strategies you can use to make the process easier, such as setting up automated responses, using templates for common inquiries, and prioritizing client communications. I do recommend using tools such as setting up automated responses, using templates for common inquiries, and prioritizing client communications to help manage your workload and respond to clients more quickly. Setting up automated responses can be a great way to acknowledge that you've received a client's message and let them know when they can expect a more detailed response. This can help manage their expectations and reduce the pressure to respond immediately. Using templates for common inquiries can also be helpful, as it allows you to quickly respond to frequently asked questions without having to write a new response each time. This can save you time and help you respond more quickly to clients. During meetings, focusing fully on myself can be a killer of a sale. While it's important to have confidence in your skills and abilities, it's equally important to give full focus on the client and their needs. I've been in my fair share of meetings where other developers only talk about themselves and their own accomplishments. When developers only talk about themselves during meetings, it can come across as arrogant or self-centered. It can also make it difficult for others to contribute to the conversation or feel heard and valued. When you focus fully on the client, you show that you're committed to understanding their needs and providing solutions that meet their specific requirements. This can help build trust and credibility with clients, which can lead to more sales and higher earnings. Plus giving full focus on a client during a meeting can help you stand out from other developers. In addition, when I show interest in the client's ideas and contributions, it can lead to more productive and collaborative meetings. It can also help build stronger relationships with the client, which can lead to more success and higher earnings. Another tip I would give is apply only to jobs that have clear descriptions where client has put in work to write description. Let me explain the importance of this and how it can benefit you in the long run. First off, a well-written job description tells me that the client is serious about the project and has invested their time and effort into detailing their requirements. This not only helps me understand the project better but also indicates the client's professionalism, which I believe is a strong foundation for a healthy working relationship. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this lesson, thank you for tuning in.

Additionally, clear job descriptions make the entire application process smoother. With a detailed understanding of the project, I can tailor my proposal to the client's specific needs and showcase my expertise, increasing my chances of being hired. Lastly, applying to jobs with comprehensive descriptions means I'm likely to face fewer surprises along the way. When I know what to expect, I can better manage my workload and deliver high-quality work on time, which in turn boosts my reputation as a remote developer. So, my fellow developers, as you embark on your journey to make over 5000 dollars monthly, remember that clear job descriptions are your friends. I've found that using attachments in job proposals can make a significant difference when it comes to standing out from the competition. Let me share with you why I believe this is an essential practice that can boost your chances of closing a client. When I attach a document to my job proposal, it immediately conveys to the client that I'm detail-oriented and thorough. This is especially important in our industry, where attention to detail can be the difference between a successful project and a failed one. By including an attachment, I'm already setting myself apart as someone who goes the extra mile to ensure a smooth project execution. Another great reason to use attachments in your job proposals is that it allows you to showcase your work in a more tangible and visually appealing way. Including a well-curated portfolio of your previous projects can give the client a clear idea of your skills and capabilities, making them more likely to consider you for the job. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words, right?

Additionally, if you're applying for a job that requires a specific skill set or approach, a screen share or video attachment can be a game-changer. In this case, I like to create a short video where I outline how I plan to execute the project, discussing my thoughts on the technologies and methodologies I would use. This not only demonstrates my expertise but also helps the client visualize how I'd bring their project to life. Let's take a look at creating proposals. To begin, I always start with an attention-grabbing opener or a pattern interrupt. This is crucial because it captures the client's interest and makes them curious to learn more about me and my proposal. A powerful opening line could be a thought-provoking question, a surprising fact, or a compelling statement related to their project. It's also first thing client see when looking at proposals without opening them and choosing which one to view. Next, instead of talking about myself like most freelancers, I dive right into the work. I discuss the project's process and explain what I'll do for the client. Sometimes, I even build a small prototype to demonstrate my understanding and commitment to their project. This approach shows that I'm proactive and action-oriented, which clients love. After that, I share my relevant experience to build credibility with the client. I mention specific projects or accomplishments that are directly related to the job at hand. This way, the client can see that I have a proven track record and can trust me with their project. Then, I summarize my approach to the job, emphasizing my long-term commitment to providing value and building a strong relationship with the client. This shows that I'm not just interested in completing a one-off project, but rather, in becoming a reliable and trusted partner for their ongoing development needs. Finally, I end my proposal with a call to action or by creating a sense of urgency. I might ask when we can schedule a meeting or propose a timeline for starting the project. This encourages the client to take the next step and engage with me further. By following this proposal formula, I've been able to differentiate myself from other freelancers and secure some fantastic remote developer opportunities. I'm confident that this approach will help you too. You almost wanna provide so much value in your proposal that client feels like he has to respond and reach out. Providing value in your proposal can create a sense of urgency for the client. If they see that you have a clear understanding of their needs and can provide a comprehensive solution, they may feel like they need to act quickly to secure your services. This can help to speed up the sales process and make it more likely that you'll close the deal. Furthermore, providing value in your proposal can set you apart from your competition. When clients receive proposals from multiple freelancers, they're more likely to choose the one that stands out and provides the most value. By going above and beyond in your proposal, you're demonstrating that you're willing to put in the effort to deliver exceptional results. When sending out proposals, it's essential to answer every question in the job description. By doing so, you're demonstrating that you've taken the time to thoroughly understand the client's needs and that you're the right person for the job. However, what do you do when there's missing information in the job description?

In this case, it's important to ask the client for more information in your proposal. When you're missing critical details, it's better to clarify them upfront rather than making assumptions that could lead to miscommunication down the line. By asking for more information, you're showing the client that you're attentive to their needs and that you're invested in providing the best possible solution. Focusing on speed is also vital part of every freelancer's success. When you're dealing with potential clients, you need to move quickly and decisively. You want to be the first person to respond to their inquiry, and you want to make sure that you're providing them with all the information they need to make a decision. The longer you wait, the more likely it is that someone else will swoop in and snatch up the opportunity. But it's not just about being fast. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this lesson, thank you for tuning in.

You also need to be effective. You need to be able to communicate your value proposition clearly and concisely, and you need to be able to address any concerns or objections that the client might have. The key is to strike a balance between speed and quality. You want to be quick, but you also want to make sure that you're providing a high level of service. Another benefit of focusing on speed is that it helps you build momentum. When you're closing deals quickly, you're building a reputation as someone who is reliable and efficient. This can lead to more opportunities down the road, as clients start to refer you to their colleagues and friends. So, if you want to be a successful freelancer, it's essential to focus on speed. Make sure that you're responding to inquiries quickly, providing clear and concise information, and closing deals as efficiently as possible. By doing so, you'll be well on your way to achieving your financial goals and building a thriving freelance career. Pricing yourself competitively is crucial for any freelancer looking to close deals and build a successful business. When you're competing against other freelancers, it's important to offer a fair and reasonable price for your services. But why is pricing yourself competitively so important?

Firstly, pricing yourself competitively can help you to win more jobs. When clients are comparing proposals from multiple freelancers, they're often looking for the best value for their money. If you're pricing yourself too high, you may be passed over in favor of someone who offers a similar service at a lower price. By pricing yourself competitively, you're more likely to be considered for the job and to win the client's business. Secondly, pricing yourself competitively can help you to build long-term relationships with clients. When you offer fair and reasonable prices, you're demonstrating that you're invested in the client's success and that you're not just in it for the money. This can help to build trust and loyalty over time, leading to more repeat business and referrals. Lastly, pricing yourself competitively can help you to stay competitive in the market. The freelance industry is constantly changing, and pricing trends can shift rapidly. By keeping your prices competitive, you're demonstrating that you're aware of these changes and that you're willing to adapt to stay ahead of the curve. With pricing yourself competitively, offering a winning proposal, and giving full attention to the client are all crucial elements of a successful strategy for closing deals. By demonstrating your value, understanding the client's needs, and providing exceptional service, you'll be well on your way to winning more business and building a successful freelance career. When you're applying for freelance jobs, it's important to be strategic about which jobs you apply to. One key strategy is to apply only to recent jobs, rather than jobs that have been posted for a long time. But why is this strategy so important?

The main reason is that when jobs are posted for a long time, they tend to receive a large number of proposals. When there are too many proposals, it becomes difficult for the client to review them all thoroughly. This means that your proposal may get lost in the shuffle, even if you're highly qualified for the job. On the other hand, when you apply to recent jobs, there are typically fewer proposals to compete with. This means that your proposal is more likely to be noticed by the client and given serious consideration. By focusing on recent jobs, you're increasing your chances of standing out from the crowd and winning the job. Another benefit of focusing on recent jobs is that they're often more urgent. Clients typically post jobs when they have an immediate need that they're looking to fill. By focusing on recent jobs, you're more likely to find clients who are ready to make a decision quickly, which can help you to close deals faster and earn more money. When you're on a call with a potential client, it's important to keep the conversation focused on the project details and the business at hand. While it's tempting to chat about personal topics or other unrelated matters, doing so can actually hurt your chances of closing the deal. It's crucial to keep the call on a straight line. What does the straight line mean?

It means keeping the conversation focused on the project details. Staying on topic can help you to establish trust and credibility with the client. When you demonstrate your expertise and knowledge of the project, you're showing the client that you have the skills and experience needed to deliver results. This can help to build trust and confidence, making it more likely that the client will choose to work with you. Keeping the conversation focused on the project can help you to close the deal more quickly. When you're able to provide clear and concise information about the project and your approach to it, you're making it easier for the client to make a decision. This can help to speed up the sales process and help you to close more deals in less time. Overall, keeping the call on a straight line and focused on the project details is crucial. Show your passion for the work and to demonstrate your expertise. One way to do this is by talking about similar projects that you've worked on in the past. Firstly, talking about similar projects shows that you have relevant experience and expertise. Clients want to work with freelancers who have a track record of success and who understand the unique challenges of their project. By sharing your experiences, you're demonstrating that you have the skills and knowledge needed to deliver results. Secondly, talking about similar projects can help you to establish a connection with the client. When you're able to relate your past experiences to the client's project, it shows that you understand their needs and that you're invested in their success. This can help to build trust and rapport, making it more likely that the client will choose to work with you. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this lesson, thank you for tuning in.

Lastly, talking about similar projects can help to show your passion for the work. When you're able to speak enthusiastically about your past projects and the challenges you've overcome, it demonstrates that you're passionate about what you do. This can help to inspire confidence in the client and show them that you're the right person for the job. As a freelancer, it's important to recommend a clear plan of action to your clients and make sure that you have their response on it. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no misunderstandings about what needs to be done. A plan of action is a detailed strategy that outlines the steps that need to be taken to achieve a specific goal. When you recommend a plan of action, it shows that you're proactive and invested in the success of the project. Clients want to work with freelancers who can take the lead and provide guidance on what needs to be done. By recommending a plan of action, you're demonstrating that you have a clear understanding of the project and that you're committed to delivering results. However, it's not enough to just recommend a plan of action - you also need to make sure that the client is on board with it. When the client is able to provide feedback on the plan, it helps to ensure that their needs and expectations are being met. This can help to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that the project stays on track. Getting the client's response on the plan of action is also important because it can help to build trust and confidence. When the client sees that you're willing to listen to their feedback and make changes as needed, it demonstrates that you're invested in their success and that you're committed to delivering a high-quality product. This can help to build trust and confidence, making it more likely that the client will choose to work with you again in the future. One key element of closing deals is establishing next steps in the project. It's not enough to simply agree on the initial scope of work and deliverables. You need to map out a clear path forward so that your client knows exactly what to expect and when. I always make sure to establish next steps during the initial consultation with the client. This includes setting deadlines for deliverables, scheduling check-ins to review progress, and outlining any additional steps that need to be taken before the project can be considered complete. By being proactive about establishing next steps, you'll not only show your clients that you're organized and professional, but you'll also help ensure that the project stays on track and is completed on time. When it comes to closing deals as a remote developer, the devil is in the details. It's important to go above and beyond in order to show your clients that you care about their project and are invested in their success. One way to demonstrate this is by including their logo and other branding elements in any documents or presentations you create for the project. Not only does this show that you've taken the time to familiarize yourself with their brand, but it also helps to make the project feel more personalized and tailored to their needs. In addition to including their logo, I also like to take the time to understand the client's unique requirements and preferences. This can include things like their preferred communication style, their timeline for the project, and any specific technical requirements they may have. By demonstrating that you're willing to go the extra mile to accommodate their needs, you'll increase the chances of closing the deal and establishing a long-term partnership. It's important to prioritize effective communication and collaboration with your clients. This means listening carefully to their needs and concerns, and working together to find the best solutions for their project. While it's important to stand by your expertise and experience, it's never productive to directly disagree with a client or dismiss their ideas out of hand. Instead, take the time to understand their perspective and why they may be proposing a certain approach or solution. Once you've gained a clear understanding of their perspective, you can then provide your own insights and expertise in a way that's constructive and respectful. This could include suggesting alternative approaches that still meet their needs, or providing additional information that could help them make a more informed decision. One of the most important things you can do when talking to a client is to research the client and their needs. This includes finding out if they have hired freelancers in the past and what their experience was like. It's also important to understand what they are looking for in this project specifically so that you can tailor your approach accordingly. One thing I always try to do when working with clients is to get their phone number if possible. This allows me to quickly and easily reach out to them if I have any questions or concerns. In fact, if I do manage to get a client's phone number while on a call with them, I make a point to send them a quick text right away. This helps to establish a line of communication and ensures that we are both on the same page. It also shows the client that I am proactive and responsive, which can help to build trust and confidence in my abilities. Of course, it's important to be respectful of the client's time and to use their phone number appropriately. I never want to come across as pushy or intrusive, so I always make sure to ask if it's okay to text or call them before doing so. I also try to keep my messages brief and to the point, focusing on the key information or questions that need to be addressed. Overall, getting a client's phone number can be a valuable tool in building strong relationships. While it's important to build rapport and establish a relationship with your clients, I find that small talk can often be a distraction and take up valuable time. 

Hope you guys enjoyed this lesson, thank you for tuning in.

Instead, I like to get straight to the point and focus on the business at hand. This allows us to make the most of our time together and ensures that we are able to address any issues or concerns efficiently. Of course, this doesn't mean that I'm not personable or friendly with my clients. I still believe that it's important to build a positive working relationship with them. However, I try to do this in a way that is focused on business and keeps the conversation moving forward. Ultimately, avoiding small talk and keeping the focus on business is a key component of closing a deal. When I'm on a call with a client, I make sure to take detailed notes about what we discuss. This includes any specific requirements or requests they have, as well as any deadlines or milestones we need to hit. I also try to record any action items or next steps that we agree upon, so that I can follow up on them later. In addition to taking notes during the call, I also make a point to write up a summary of our conversation afterward. This helps to ensure that I have a clear understanding of what was discussed and that I haven't missed anything important. It also provides a written record of our conversation that I can refer back to later if needed. I've learned to trust my gut when it comes to deciding whether to take on a new project or work with a new client. When considering a new opportunity, I always try to get a sense of the client's communication style, work style, and overall demeanor. If something doesn't feel right or if I get a bad feeling about the client, I listen to that instinct and carefully consider whether the opportunity is a good fit for me. Of course, this doesn't mean that I'm always quick to judge or dismiss potential clients. I still approach every opportunity with an open mind and try to gather as much information as possible before making a decision. However, I've found that my gut feeling can be a valuable tool in helping me make informed decisions and avoid potentially problematic situations. I always make sure to have a detailed discussion with the client about what they are looking for and what they expect to receive. This includes establishing clear deliverables and milestones, as well as any specific requirements or constraints that need to be taken into account. I also make sure to document these deliverables and requirements in writing, so that we both have a clear understanding of what will be delivered and what the expectations are. This can include creating a detailed project plan, outlining specific tasks and deadlines, and defining any dependencies or risks that need to be taken into account. By setting clear deliverables and expectations upfront, you can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal. This can help to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications down the line, and can ultimately lead to a more successful project outcome. If a client tells me that they are considering other offers, my first instinct is to try to understand their perspective and find out what factors they are considering in their decision. One approach I might take is to ask the client why they are considering multiple offers and whether there is anything specific they are looking for in a developer or in the project. This can help me to better understand their needs and preferences, and may give me insights into areas where I can differentiate myself from the competition. I might also offer to provide more information about my qualifications, skills, and experience to help the client make an informed decision. For example, I might suggest that we have a follow-up call or exchange emails where I can answer any questions the client might have and provide additional details about my work. Finally, I might offer to suggest specific ways in which I can help the client achieve their goals and address their specific needs. For example, I might offer to provide additional support during a critical phase of the project, or to work closely with the client to ensure that their needs are being met. When you are on a call or talking to a client have 100% conviction you can finish the project. Having 100% conviction in my ability to complete a project is about being confident in my skills. While closing the deal most effective approach is to allocate my time as follows:

10% on closing the deal: This means being clear and concise in presenting my proposal and negotiating terms with the client. 40% on building the relationship: This includes getting to know the client, understanding their needs and preferences, and building trust and rapport. 30% on identifying the needs: This means asking the right questions and gathering all the necessary information to ensure that I have a clear understanding of what the client is looking for. 20% on presenting the solution: This means putting together a well-crafted proposal that clearly outlines how I plan to address the client's needs and deliver high-quality work. Developing instant rapport with clients is an important part of closing deals and establishing yourself as an expert in your field

For example, I might ask the client about their background or interests, or share a bit about my own experiences working in the industry. By doing so, I can help to establish a sense of familiarity and trust, which can make the client more comfortable working with me and more likely to view me as an expert in my field. Another approach I've found to be effective is to demonstrate my expertise in a way that is relevant and meaningful to the client. This might involve sharing examples of similar projects I've worked on, highlighting my skills and qualifications, or providing recommendations or insights based on my experience. Ultimately, the key to developing instant rapport and establishing yourself as an expert is to approach the situation with confidence, enthusiasm, and a genuine desire to help the client achieve their goals. I've found that clients often come to me because they have a problem that they need help solving.

This might be a technical issue with their website or software, or a broader business problem that requires a technical solution. Regardless of the specific nature of the problem, I've found that clients are usually looking to gain control of the situation and find a solution that meets their needs. As a remote developer, my job is to help them achieve this goal by providing expert advice, recommendations, and technical solutions. And that is where my focus is aligning with them and giving them my full attention. This means being a good listener and taking the time to understand the client's needs and objectives. It also means being proactive and taking the initiative to suggest solutions and approaches that may help to address the problem. We talked a lot about closing the deal, talking to a client, dealing with specific issues. If I had to put it in a framework I would do following. Number one Ask questions. The first thing you need to do when trying to close a sale is to ask your client questions. This is crucial because it helps you understand their needs and concerns. Asking the right questions can show your genuine interest in their project and make them feel comfortable with you. Remember, people love talking about themselves and their projects, so make sure you take the time to listen. Number two Gather intelligence. Once you've got a solid understanding of their needs, it's time to gather more information. Find out if they've hired someone else for the project in the past, how they found that person, and what they liked or disliked about their work. This can give you valuable insights into how to position yourself as the best choice for their project. Number three Build a logical and emotional case. Now that you have all the information, it's time to build a case for why you're the perfect candidate for the job. You'll want to combine both logical and emotional arguments. For example, you could talk about your relevant skills and experiences (logical) and share your passion for the project (emotional). By connecting with your clients on both levels, you'll have a much better chance of convincing them to work with you. Number four Get the client to love you. Once you've built your case, the next step is to make the client love you. This is where your personality comes into play. Be genuine, honest, and friendly. Show them that you're not only skilled but also easy to work with. You can also offer a little extra value by sharing ideas or suggestions they might not have considered. By doing this, you'll demonstrate your commitment to their project and create a positive rapport with them. Number five Close the sale. Finally, it's time to close the sale. Once you feel confident that you've built a strong connection with your client and they understand the value you bring, you can ask for the sale. Be direct and confident, but also be prepared to handle objections. If they have concerns, address them honestly and calmly. Remember, closing the sale is just the beginning of a long-term relationship, so make sure you continue to provide excellent service and support after the sale is complete. And there you have it! By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to becoming a successful remote developer making over 5,000 dollars per month in no time. Lets explore a situation where, despite offering a great service, meeting the client's budget, and deadline expectations, and proving your expertise, they still don't want to hire you. It can be a tough pill to swallow, but sometimes it's essential to challenge their beliefs and better understand their thought process to help them see the value in working with you. First, let's try to understand their biggest headache with the project. By asking this question, you can identify any specific concerns they might have about the project that you haven't addressed yet. Listen carefully to their answer and offer solutions based on your skills and experience. This will demonstrate your commitment to solving their problems and achieving their goals. Next, ask them about their ultimate objective for the project. This question will help you understand their long-term vision and the factors driving their decision-making. It might also give you an opportunity to show how your skills and expertise can help them reach their goals more efficiently. Then, ask them about their ideal scenario. What would be the perfect outcome for them in this project? By getting them to describe their ideal situation, you can better understand their expectations and see if there's a gap between what you offer and what they're looking for. If there is, you can work on bridging that gap and convincing them that you're the right person to help them achieve their ideal outcome. If, after walking through their beliefs and understanding their concerns, they still aren't convinced about hiring you, it's essential to maintain a positive and professional attitude. Sometimes, no matter how well you present your case, a client simply won't be the right fit. In these cases, it's best to thank them for their time, express your hopes for a future collaboration, and move on to the next potential client. When a client is still hesitant about hiring you, it's essential to remain calm, professional, and open to their concerns. One approach you can take is to ask them if the idea you presented for developing the project makes sense to them. By doing this, you're giving them an opportunity to express any doubts they might have about your approach, which can help you better understand their concerns and adjust your proposal accordingly. When discussing your idea, make sure to highlight the key aspects of your approach that align with their goals and address their specific needs. This might involve emphasizing your expertise, offering alternative solutions, or even suggesting a trial period to showcase your abilities and commitment to their project. By asking the client if your idea makes sense, you're showing respect for their opinion and demonstrating your willingness to collaborate and adapt your approach.

If they have any concerns, listen carefully and address them with confidence and professionalism. It's important to remain open to feedback and be ready to modify your proposal to better suit their needs. If, after discussing your idea and addressing their concerns, the client still isn't ready to hire you, it's essential to maintain a positive attitude and leave the door open for future opportunities. Remember, rejection is a natural part of the process, and learning how to handle it gracefully is an important skill to develop as you work towards becoming a remote developer. When engaging with clients, it's crucial to remember that they are the ones with the problems and goals they need you to address. So, instead of dominating the conversation, make sure to give them ample opportunity to speak and share their thoughts. Actively listen to what they're saying, and resist the urge to interrupt or narrate their answers. People appreciate being heard, and it will help you build a rapport with them. As they share their concerns, needs, and expectations, take mental notes and look for opportunities to align your responses with their answers. This will show that you've been listening attentively and that you genuinely understand their situation. When you respond, reiterate their concerns and provide tailored solutions based on the information they shared. This way, you demonstrate that you're on the same page and that you're committed to addressing their specific needs. For example, if a client expresses concerns about the project's deadline, you can reassure them by outlining your plan to meet the deadline and sharing your experience working on similar projects with tight schedules. By doing this, you not only show empathy but also offer tangible solutions that demonstrate your expertise and commitment to their success. Certainty is a crucial aspect of your communication with clients. When you speak with confidence about your skills, experience, and the solutions you can provide, clients will feel reassured that you're the right person for the job. To develop certainty, ensure you have a deep understanding of your field, your strengths, and your limitations. Practice speaking about your accomplishments and expertise with conviction, so clients can sense your self-assurance. Calmness is another vital quality to cultivate when interacting with clients. Regardless of the situation, maintaining a calm demeanor will help you come across as a composed professional. Clients will feel more at ease discussing their concerns and needs with someone who remains unflustered under pressure. To develop calmness, practice mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, and remind yourself to slow down and be present during conversations. Reasonableness is the ability to maintain a balanced and rational perspective when discussing project details, budgets, and timelines with clients. Demonstrating reasonableness can help you build trust and credibility, as clients will appreciate your fair-minded approach. To develop reasonableness, work on understanding multiple perspectives and listening carefully to clients' needs before offering solutions. Be open to negotiation and willing to find middle ground when necessary. Sometimes, during the course of a conversation or call with a client, you might realize that they may not perceive you as the ideal candidate for the job. In such situations, it's crucial to go back and reassure them of your capabilities and expertise. If you notice that the client is unsure about your suitability for the project, it's essential to address their concerns immediately. Take a moment to ask them if there's anything specific that's causing them to have doubts about your skills or experience. This will help you better understand their concerns and give you an opportunity to address them directly. Once you've identified the issues, provide concrete examples and evidence to demonstrate your expertise and how it aligns with their needs. Highlight your relevant skills, past successes, and industry knowledge, and explain how these factors make you the perfect fit for their project. If possible, share testimonials or case studies from previous clients to support your claims and further build credibility.
