Let's talk about marketplaces, I would like to emphasize the importance of exploring various freelance marketplaces such as Fiverr, Freelancer.com, and others, in addition to Upwork. Should you signup on multiple platforms? You can do that that is an option. But lets first explore what you are looking for and where you would fit in because every platform has specific benefits. Every platform is fitting in much larger marketplace which is connecting companies to freelancers and they also have to find their own fit. There cannot be two upwork websites that would serve no purpose so that's why I wanna talk about choosing your marketplace as a part of the course. I see too many people just sign up on upwork as it's deemed as a most popular option. Or they sign up everywhere expecting the more work the better but the truth is dominating just one platform as a top freelancer is more than enough. And not only is it more than enough but giving focus on one platform and ranking up there, will benefit you a lot more in the future than trying to fit all of the marketplaces. Let's explore our options and by end of this module I want you think and find which marketplace you will be selling on.
When working on Fiverr, I've found that the platform is designed around a gig-based system, which allows freelancers to offer their services in the form of fixed-price packages. This structure makes it easy for you to create and sell services tailored to your expertise. Moreover, Fiverr focuses on smaller, quicker projects, which is great if you prefer to work on multiple short-term tasks rather than committing to long-term projects. When I was selling on Fiverr there were weeks where I would have 10 projects per week and each order on average was 200 dollars and few hours of work. Fiverr has evolved a lot since I was selling there these days you can also post ads.
Fiverr operates with a different approach compared to other platforms, as it focuses on a gig-based system. This means that, instead of bidding on projects, you'll create service packages or "gigs" showcasing your skills and expertise. Potential clients will then browse and purchase your gigs based on their needs. This model allows you to define the scope, timeline, and pricing for your services, giving you greater control over your work and schedule.
As a software developer on Fiverr, you'll find a wide variety of gig categories to choose from, such as web development, mobile app development, database design, or even specialized areas like blockchain development or machine learning. This diversity provides you with ample opportunities to offer your services in areas where you excel or explore new niches to expand your skills.
One characteristic of Fiverr is that it often caters to smaller, shorter-term projects. This can be an advantage if you enjoy working on multiple tasks simultaneously or prefer to avoid long-term commitments. However, it's essential to manage your time effectively to ensure you can deliver quality work within the agreed-upon deadlines.

When setting up your gigs, you'll need to create eye-catching titles, descriptions, and visuals that accurately represent your services and attract potential clients. Throughout this course, I'll provide you with tips and best practices for crafting compelling gig listings that can help you stand out in the crowded marketplace.
Fiverr's review and rating system plays a crucial role in your success on the platform. As you complete projects, clients will provide feedback and rate your work. A strong track record of positive reviews can boost your visibility on the platform, making it easier for you to secure more clients and even charge higher rates for your services.

I'd like to share my experiences and observations about the competition you can expect when selling your services on the platform.
Fiverr has become increasingly popular over the years, attracting a large and diverse pool of freelancers. As a software developer, you're likely to encounter competition from professionals across the globe, with varying levels of experience and skill sets.

Lastly, it's important to be aware of the fees associated with using Upwork. The platform uses a sliding fee scale, which means that the percentage-based fees decrease as your total earnings from a single client increase. This rewards long-term client relationships and encourages repeat business.

These professionals possess a wide range of skills, expertise, and experience levels, making the marketplace quite competitive. For newcomers to the platform, this competition can make it challenging to stand out and secure projects.

Previously, Upwork required new freelancers to take the Upwork Readiness Test, a short quiz designed to assess their understanding of the platform's policies and best practices. The purpose of the test was to ensure that freelancers had a basic understanding of how the platform worked before they could begin submitting proposals for projects.

However, Upwork has since removed the Readiness Test, streamlining the onboarding process for new freelancers. This change means that you can now get started on the platform more quickly, without the added step of completing the test.

Let's touch a bit on upwork tests and are they important part of when having profile on Upwork. From my experience, clients on Upwork tend to prioritize a freelancer's portfolio, work history, and client feedback over test scores and certifications. A strong portfolio and positive feedback from previous clients are seen as more reliable indicators of a freelancer's skills and expertise, especially in the software development field.

Moreover, the practical experience gained through real-world projects is often valued more than theoretical knowledge tested through standardized exams. Clients are usually more interested in seeing how you've applied your skills to solve real problems and the results you've achieved.

Another factor to consider is that the quality and relevance of some Upwork tests might not accurately reflect your skills and abilities as a software developer. In some cases, the tests may be outdated or not aligned with the latest industry trends and best practices, making them less useful in demonstrating your expertise.

Furthermore, clients on Upwork often have tight deadlines and specific project requirements. They might not have the time or inclination to review test scores or certifications, instead preferring to focus on your proposal, portfolio, and demonstrated ability to deliver results.
