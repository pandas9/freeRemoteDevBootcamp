I realized the importance of building a portfolio very early on. A portfolio, to me, is a visual representation of my skills, experience, and expertise, and it's what potential clients see when they consider hiring me for a project.

Hosting my portfolio on GitHub proved to be enough to demonstrate my abilities and attract potential clients. GitHub is a well-known and widely respected platform within the software development community. By hosting my portfolio there, I was instantly associated with a professional network of developers and potential clients who recognized and trusted the platform. Clients could review repositories, commit history, and contributions to open-source projects, giving them insight into my coding practices, problem-solving abilities, and collaboration skills.

However, I also realized that having a dedicated portfolio website could be a valuable asset. A well-designed and user-friendly website allowed me to present my work professionally and visually appealingly. This made a strong first impression on potential clients, setting me apart from other programmers in the industry. But, ultimately, I decided that my GitHub profile was enough for my needs.

Creating a portfolio website provided the opportunity to offer context and details about my projects, such as case studies, testimonials from previous clients, and even blog posts about experiences or industry insights. Providing this additional information demonstrated my expertise, problem-solving abilities, and passion for my craft.

In my experience, having a dedicated portfolio website can be a valuable asset for a developer. For me personally github profile was enough but its up to you to decide.

Creating and maintaining a portfolio website required time and effort. I had to balance my time between working on client projects and managing my portfolio. If I couldn't dedicate enough time to maintain a high-quality portfolio website, focusing on other platforms like GitHub was more beneficial.

Which is what I did.

Especially when starting out, how I communicated with clients benefited me a lot more than a portfolio website. I wanted to share some examples of what to do and what not to do, as showcasing some work under my belt was crucial. Deciding what to show and how much to show was a personal choice, and I hoped to provide some guidance for others in a similar position.

Journey in building a portfolio taught me invaluable lessons about showcasing my skills and experience to potential clients, helping me grow as a developer and freelancer.

I wanna show you few examples of what to do and what not to do because you have to be able to show some work under your belt. It's up to you to decide what you show and how much you show and want to give you slight guidance.

Hope you guys enjoyed this lesson, thank you for tuning in.

Now that you know where you are going to sell and what you are going sell it's time to build few examples for clients.

One strategy I've found particularly effective is to focus on what's currently trending in the technology world. By aligning your personal projects with current industry trends, you not only showcase your technical skills but also demonstrate your awareness of the market and your ability to stay up-to-date with emerging technologies.

For instance, at the time of this recording, AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a hot topic. It's being integrated into all sorts of applications, from recommendation systems to automated customer service, and it's certainly a skill that can set you apart as a developer.

Let's say you're a web developer. How can you incorporate AI into a personal project? Well, you could create a news website that uses AI. This could take many forms. For example, you could build a site that aggregates news from multiple sources and uses AI to summarize the articles. Or, you could create a site where all the content is generated by AI.

Projects like these not only showcase your coding skills but also your ability to apply cutting-edge technologies in practical, innovative ways. They allow you to demonstrate a range of competencies, from your technical know-how to your creativity and problem-solving abilities.

Personal projects are more than just a portfolio piece. They're a testament to your abilities as a developer and a window into your potential.

It's one thing to have a collection of scripts or a GitHub repository full of code; it's quite another to have a live, working application that people can actually use. When clients or employers can interact with your work firsthand, it gives them a much clearer understanding of your capabilities as a developer.

So, what do I mean when I say real-world app? I'm talking about fully functional applications that are accessible on the web and optimized for a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

These apps should be more than just experiments or prototypes. They should be polished, professional, and practical. Think about what kind of apps people use every day, and try to build something along those lines. This could be anything from a task manager to a weather app, an e-commerce store, or a blog platform. The key is to make it something people can actually use, not just look at and make sure to incorporate newest trends into your apps.

If you are building mobile apps do the same thing. Find a trend something client can relate to and build that. Always make sure to stay with latest technologies and display something clients can relate to and will enjoy.

Now, I want you to build a few of these apps. Take your time with this. Focus on one project at a time, and make sure each one is as good as it can be before moving on to the next. Remember, quality is more important than quantity. It's better to have two or three outstanding apps than a dozen mediocre ones.

Are you ready to take your personal projects to the next level?

Now, you may be wondering, "Isn't building a functional app enough?" Well, it is, but in this competitive world of remote development, going the extra mile can make all the difference. What's the extra mile, you ask? Let me tell you.

Once you've built a great app, consider treating it not just as a portfolio piece, but as a standalone product. Craft a brand around it, complete with a catchy name, a sleek logo, and even its own website. Start promoting your product on social media. Create engaging content that not only showcases your app but also delivers value to your audience.

Consider making marketing headlines for your project. For instance, if you've developed a task management app, you might use a headline like "Stay organized and boost your productivity with XYZ app!" The goal is to highlight the benefits your app provides, making it irresistible to potential users.

Now, here's the big leap: consider launching your product as a full-fledged company. This doesn't necessarily mean you have to start hiring employees or renting office space. It simply means treating your project with the same seriousness and professionalism as a startup.

This approach can have several benefits. First, it can help you stand out from other developers, as it showcases not just your technical skills, but also your entrepreneurial spirit and your ability to bring a product to market. Second, it can provide a great learning experience, teaching you invaluable skills in areas like marketing, customer service, and business strategy. And who knows? Your project might even become the next big thing in the tech world!

Once your apps are complete, we'll discuss how to showcase them effectively and how to use them to demonstrate your professional competence. But for now, let's focus on building. Let's get coding, and I can't wait to see what you all create!

Hope you guys enjoyed this lesson, thank you for tuning in.
