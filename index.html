                Bootcamp was created in early 2023 and contains everything I
                learned through my journey as a freelance dev. I started
                programming in 2020 with a few months of experience as a dev
                looked for a job and was struggling to get one which made me try
                selling programming services online to my surprise I've gotten
                to earning over $5,000 monthly in less than a year and
                kickstarted my career as developer. You can find me selling
                online under the pseudonym Voxvici.

                At first this bootcamp was paid and was hoping to make extra
                money on the side while helping few entry level devs become
                remote devs earning over $50k yearly but no one believed me and
                never found particular interest in spending months building
                online audience only then to sell the bootcamp and find fitting
                audience so decided to give it away for free.
