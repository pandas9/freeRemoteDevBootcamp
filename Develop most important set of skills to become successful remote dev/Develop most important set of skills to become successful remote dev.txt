**Where to sell & what to sell**
One of the most important decisions you'll make is selecting the right platform to sell your services. Platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer are incredible marketplaces, each with their own unique features, clientele, and ways of doing things.

Choosing the right platform isn't just about signing up on all of them and hoping for the best. It's about understanding each platform's strengths and aligning those with your skills, your work style, and the type of clients you want to work with.

Equally important is knowing what to sell. As a developer, you have a wide range of skills to offer, from front-end development, back-end development, full-stack development, to specific expertise in languages or frameworks like JavaScript, Python, React, and so on.

Knowing what to sell requires a deep understanding of your own skills and interests, the demand in the market, and the clientele of the platform. It's about finding the sweet spot where your skills and passion meet market demand.

When I first started as a remote developer, I joined all the major platforms: Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer. I was skilled in both front-end and back-end development and I offered a wide array of services across all these platforms.

However, I soon found myself stretched too thin. I was spending a lot of time bidding for projects on each platform, and I wasn't making as much progress as I had hoped. I was also finding that the kind of work I was getting was too varied, and I wasn't able to hone my skills in any particular area.

After a couple of months, I decided to take a step back and reevaluate. I realized that a lot of people wanted me for python automation and data extraction services. I also noticed that the higher-budget projects that matched my interest were more readily available on Fiverr.

So, I decided to focus my efforts on Fiverr and specifically advertise my services in Python-based automation and extraction.

This decision made a significant difference. I started to attract clients who were looking for my specific skills, and because I was working on projects that I was genuinely interested in, my performance improved. As time went off I eventually landed higher paying long term clients as it became my desire to work on long term projects instead of having ten different projects every week.

By aligning these two aspects with skills, interests, and the market demand you will achieve success extremely fast.

**Leveraging personal projects to demonstrate professional competence**
You might be wondering, can my personal projects really make an impact on my professional career? The answer is a yes. Personal projects can be a powerful way to showcase your skills.

The complexity of the project and the technologies used can show your technical depth and breadth. A project that incorporates a diverse set of technologies or solves a complex problem is important.

While there's nothing wrong with creating your own version of a calculator or a to-do list, projects that offer unique value or solve an uncommon problem is what clients are looking for.

A crucial step in demonstrating your capabilities as a developer is to deploy your work. This means taking your impressive app from the development stage to a live product. Purchase a domain and launch your creation as a minimally viable product. This tangible, usable product serves as concrete evidence of your skills and abilities.

There's a widespread misconception that personal projects are insignificant, and that clients are only interested in seasoned developers with years of experience. This couldn't be further from the truth. The moment clients can interact with your work and witness your potential, trust begins to form. Even if your app doesn't have many users, it's not a concern. The client isn't there to invest in your app; they're there to evaluate if you have the skills and capability to build their app. Your personal projects serve as a testament to this capability, helping you establish credibility and earn the trust of potential clients.

**Selling & closing deals**
As developers, we're more comfortable with code than with sales pitches. We excel at solving problems, crafting algorithms, and building applications, but when it comes to selling our skills, we might find ourselves a bit out of our element. This gap in our skill set can often slow our progress on platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer. But, rest assured, this is a skill that can be learned and perfected over time.

Here's the truth: being a successful remote developer isn't just about being a great coder. It's also about effectively communicating your value to potential clients. It's about understanding their needs and showing them how your skills and experience can help solve their problems.

In other words, whether we like it or not, we need to embrace the role of a salesperson to some extent. We have to learn how to sell our expertise in a way that resonates with clients, inspires their trust, and convinces them that we're the right person for the job.

But here's the good news: you don't need to become a pushy salesperson to achieve this. You just need to learn how to communicate effectively, negotiate fairly, and build strong relationships with your clients.

**Understanding what client wants**
While years of experience can certainly contribute to your skill set as a developer, they are not the be-all and end-all. What clients are truly interested in is your capability to develop their app effectively and efficiently. They want to know that you have the right skills, the right approach, and the right mindset to bring their vision to life.

That's where two crucial elements come into play: communication skills and leveraging personal projects.

It's not just about speaking or writing fluently in a particular language, though that's certainly part of it. It's also about clearly understanding the client's needs and conveying how you plan to meet those needs. It's about managing expectations, providing updates, handling feedback, and navigating challenges together. Good communication builds trust and confidence, making clients more likely to hire you.

As we mentioned before, personal projects are a tangible demonstration of your skills and capabilities. They are live proof that you can not only write code but also complete a project, troubleshoot issues, and deliver a functional product. By turning your personal projects into real apps that people can use, you're showing potential clients that you can do the same for them.

**Finding high paying clients**
As remote developers, we have a world of opportunities available to us. With platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer, we can connect with clients from all corners of the globe. However, not all clients are created equal. Some clients are willing and able to pay more for quality work. These are the clients we want to attract.

Remember, finding high-paying clients is not about luck. It's about having the right skills, the right strategies, and the right mindset. So let's get started on mastering these skills and propelling your remote development career to new heights!

**Displaying expertise**
When potential clients approach you, they're likely considering multiple candidates. Their time is valuable, and they're eager to identify the right person for their project as quickly as possible. This means you need to be able to demonstrate your competence and expertise swiftly and effectively.

**Writing proposals**
A potential client posts a job. They're inundated with dozens, maybe even hundreds of proposals. Now, ask yourself, how can you stand out? How can you ensure that your proposal catches their attention and convinces them that you're the right person for the job? This is exactly what you are going to learn.

Writing a good proposal is an art. It's your first point of contact with a potential client, and it sets the tone for all your future interactions. A well-crafted proposal does more than just express your interest in a project; it showcases your understanding of the client's needs, your expertise in addressing those needs, and your ability to communicate effectively.

A good proposal can be the difference between landing a high-paying client and being overlooked.

**Breaking down complex problems**
In the world of remote development, you'll often encounter projects that, at first glance, may seem overwhelming in their complexity. However, no matter how intricate a project may seem, it can always be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts. Being able to do this effectively is a skill that can truly set you apart from other developers on platforms.

Being able to break down complex projects is a testament to your problem-solving skills, your understanding of the development process, and your ability to communicate effectively with clients. It's an invaluable skill that can truly make you stand out in the world of remote development.

**Align your vision with clients**
Belief that clients will approach them with a perfect solution ready, and all they have to do is code it.

In reality, this is seldom the case. More often than not, clients come with a problem or an idea, but they look to you, the expert, to help them formulate the optimal solution. This is where your skills as not just a developer, but also as a problem solver and communicator come into play.

Aligning your vision with the client's vision is a critical part of the remote developer's job. This involves understanding their needs and objectives, suggesting improvements, and collaborating with them to come up with a plan that is both efficient and cost-effective.

**Managing your time and being adaptable**
Effective time management. This is something I can't stress enough. If you can't manage your time effectively and maintain productive work hours, succeeding as a remote developer will be an uphill battle.

Unlike in traditional office-based roles, where companies often have set structures and routines to help you stay on track, in the remote development world, you are your own boss. It's up to you to set your hours, manage your workflow, and keep yourself accountable. And while this flexibility is one of the great advantages of remote work, it can also be one of its greatest challenges.

Effective time management isn't just about logging hours; it's about making sure those hours count. It's about productivity, not just activity. You could work 12-hour days, but if you're not managing your time effectively, you might find that you're not getting as much done as you should be.

So, how can we ensure that we're making the most of our time? One of the methods I've found most effective is to track my work hours. This doesn't just mean clocking in and out; it means keeping a record of what I'm doing during those hours. At the end of each day, I review my log, reflecting on what I accomplished, where I could improve, and where I might have wasted time.
